# UnityGame1-YouWontScape
This is my own first project in Unity, made for a subject of the Computer Engine degree.

In the game, the player must survive a hunt by shooting the monster, hiding (and being lucky of not be found), searching for new bullets and keep shooting the monster to death. 

The monster uses an A* algorithm to make a pathfinding to the player, and when hiding, searchs him randomly in one of the nearest hiding places, including the player's.

## **things to be improved in the game in the future:**

- AI system: in the pathfinding, monster should detect that he's going over ground textures instead of trying to detect collisions. Also, trying to make it more fair when finding the player by making the monster search him in the monster's most near hidding place, but also making the possibility of finding the player, based on a percentage depending on the difficulty.

- Interface: depending on difficulty, making a more or less specific aid to the player for finding bullets.

- Animations and sounds: review the timing between animations and the associated sounds, to make them more accurated
